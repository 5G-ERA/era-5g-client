# era-5g-client

A client application for 5G-ERA NetApps. Contains the basic implementation of the client (client.py) and extended client for NetApps using the *gstreamer* for image stream transport. Besides, two classes for sending data using the h264 stream are presented.

## Reference implementation

The reference implementation of the NetApp client is provided in the file tests/test_client_gstreamer.py.

## Installation

The package could be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install era_5g_client
```

## Examples

Two example clients are provided to test the NetApp

### Using middleware and gstreamer (test/test_client_gstreamer.py)

The first example uses middleware to deploy the NetApp and to handle its life cycle. Therefore, the NetApp needs to be uploaded to the accessible docker repository and the NetApp needs to be registered within the middleware. Basic configuration needs to be provided:

- **server_ip**: IP address or hostname of the computer, where the middleware runs
- **user**: the GUID of the registered user
- **password**: the password of the registered user
- **task_id**: the GUID of the task that should be initialized

The user and password could be registered with the **/register** endpoint on the middleware (using Postman for example).

### Avoiding middleware, using gstreamer transport (test/test_client_gstreamer_no_middleware.py)

For local testing, the middleware could be avoided, so the NetApp needs to be started manually. Basic configuration needs to be provided:

- **netapp_uri**: ip address or hostname of the computer, where the NetApp is deployed
- **netapp_port**: port of the NetApp's server (default is 5896)

### Avoiding middleware, using http transport (test/test_client_gstreamer_no_middleware.py)

The config is the same as in the previous case, but instead of GStreamer, the images are sent to the REST endpoint of the NetApp, so the timestamps are preserved and the results could be drawn into the images and shown. 

## Classes

### NetAppClient (client.py)

Basic implementation of the client. Allows to register with the NetApp and setup a websocket-based communication for reading of results.

### NetAppClientGstreamer (client_gstreamer.py)

Besides the basic functionality of the client, this class allows to setup a gstreamer-based channel for h264 stream transport.

### DataSenderGStreamer (data_sender_gstreamer.py)

Class which allows to construct the h264 stream using gstreamer and send it to the NetApp.

### DataSenderGStreamerFromSource (data_sender_gstreamer_from_source.py)

Class which utilizes gstreamer source (e.g. v4l2src for grabbing stream from webcamera) and pass it to the NetApp.

## Contributing, development

- Any contribution should go through a pull request from your fork.
- Before commiting, please run locally:
  - `./pants fmt ::` - format all code according to our standard.
  - `./pants lint ::` - checks formatting and few more things.
  - `./pants check ::` - runs type checking (mypy).
- The same checks will be run within CI.
- A virtual environment with all necessary dependencies can be generated using `./pants export ::`. You may then activate the environment and add `era_5g_client` to your `PYTHONPATH`, which is equivalent to installing a package using `pip install -e`.
- To generate distribution packages (`tar.gz` and `whl`), you may run `./pants package ::`.
- For commit messages, please stick to [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- The package depends on `opencv-contrib-python`, but for full functionality, one has to compile OpenCV with support for GStreamer (we will provide pre-compiled whl in a near future).
